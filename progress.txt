note different models used (o1 preview/claude 3.7 Sonnet) in copilot + gpt 4o in web

- refactored the game so its class that is accessible from future solver files
- needed to fix some functions, edit class constructor
- tested random solver, works...
- went into separated chatgpt window and asked what algorithmic solutions do we have
and what are differences
- decided to create 3 solvers (snake pattern, greedy search, reinforcement learning)
- SnakePatternSolver was generated on first try using Claude 3.7 Sonnet
    - the i told him to edit it so it runs 30 times and returns some basic statistics
    - also added tracking of winning games
    - i ran it 300times with 0 wins
